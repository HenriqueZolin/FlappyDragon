# FlappyDragon
A game based in the famous "FlappyBird"

Using Java for the code and "Piskel" for the pixelart work, open src for the complete classes, images, sounds and the main code - "FlappyBird"
At first i would use the original images, that is why the names are the same of the original base game.
